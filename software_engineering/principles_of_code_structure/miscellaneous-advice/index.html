        <h1 id="miscellaneous-advice">Miscellaneous Advice</h1>
<p>Some advice on low-level code constructions that nevertheless have a big impact on code readability.</p>
<h2 id="name-things-clearly">Name Things Clearly</h2>
<p>Everything in your code should have a name that is precise, descriptive, and at the appropriate level of abstraction.  Then your code can be said to be <em>self-documenting</em>.  If the reader trusts that all names have been chosen with care, then the reader can understand the code much more quickly because the names describe what each piece is and does.  Self-documenting code also needs fewer comments to explain the code.</p>
<p>However, naming things is <em>hard</em>.  The skill of naming things well takes a long time to develop.  Perhaps this skill is one signifier of a 'senior engineer'.  Here are some guidelines to consider when trying to find a suitable name.</p>
<p>For clarity, consider a simple floating-point number variable that needs a self-documenting name.  The variable name could:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe what it <strong>is</strong>, in the sense of 'how it was constructed'.  For example, a variable computed from the sum some financial transactions could be called <code>sum_of_transactions</code>.</li>
<li>Describe what it will be <strong>used for</strong>.  For example, if the variable is fed into a function that ultimately generates a financial statement, then an appropriate name could be <code>sum_for_statement_generator</code>.</li>
<li>Describe what is <strong>is</strong>, in the sense of 'what it means, in the context of the problem domain'.  For example, if the variable <em>actually</em> represents net profit, then an obvious candidate name would be <code>net_profit</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Options 1 and 2 are the easiest to work with.  Either one would likely add <em>considerably</em> more value than a vague variable name such as <code>val</code>.</p>
<p>However, Option 3 is likely to be the most valuable.  Describing the <em>meaning</em> of a variable, <em>why it matters</em>, will generally give the most insight into what the code as a whole is supposed to achieve.  But this is also generally the most difficult option to implement: It requires a proper understanding of the problem domain, and the skill at seeing the correct level of abstraction to describe this small part of the domain.</p>
<p>Naming things is <em>hard</em>.  But the payoff of good, self-documenting variable names is huge, so persevere in finding them.</p>
<h2 id="code-hygiene">Code Hygiene</h2>
<p>The phrase 'code hygiene' is sometimes used to refer to the practice of cleaning up temporary files and other sundry mess resulting from software development, and keeping necessary configuration files <em>etc</em> in a tidy state.  The idea is to keep your engineering workspace in a state that minimises confusion.  A few hints follow.</p>
<p>Don't call a file <code>data.txt</code>.  Call it what it is.  Spend 60 seconds thinking of a great name.  This will save <em>many minutes</em> in the future.  So call it something like <code>user_accounts_2023-01-21.txt</code></p>
<p>Delete temporary files as soon as you can.  They are supposed to be <em>temporary</em>.</p>
<p>A common problem is that you can't delete a temporary file immediately, because you may need it again in a few hours or days.  So try this trick:  Put a deletion date in the file name. Eg.</p>
<p><code>user_accounts_2023-01-21_DELETE_AFTER_2023-02-01.txt</code></p>
<p>Then, in six months time, when you stumble across this long-dead file again, you won't have to spend time investigating whether or not it is safe to delete.</p>
<h2 id="use-inclusive-exclusive-ranges">Use Inclusive-Exclusive Ranges</h2>
<p>Famed computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra wrote an essay in 1982 explaining why the best convention to describe a range of numbers is to have an <strong>inclusive</strong> lower bound and an <strong>exclusive</strong> upper bound.  In mathematics, this corresponds to the <em>half-open interval</em> with a <em>closed</em> lower bound and an <em>open</em> upper bound, denoted <code>[a, b)</code>, where <code>a</code> is contained in the interval, but <code>b</code> is not.</p>
<p>To illustrate by example, a range of natural numbers defined by the pair <code>[3, 6)</code> denotes the numbers <code>[3, 4, 5]</code>.  In other words, the the lower bound (<code>3</code>) is <strong>included</strong> in the range, and the upper bound (<code>6</code>) is <strong>excluded</strong> from the range.</p>
<p>To summarise Dijkstra's reasoning:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The number of elements in the range is simply upper bound minus lower bound.  (This convenient arithmetic is not true for the inclusive/inclusive or exclusive/exclusive conventions.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lowest natural number, zero, can be included in a range, without having the lower bound go outside of the set of natural numbers.  (The lower bound is zero; it doesn't have to be eg. -1, as it might for the convention of an <em>exclusive</em> lower bound.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For two <em>adjacent</em> ranges, the upper bound of one is the lower bound of the other.  So if one wants to define a new range 'starting from' an existing range, the lower bound is already known; no calculation is required.  (Without this convention, calculating the lower bound of the new adjacent range can be surprisingly non-trivial, especially for time ranges.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Doctor Dijkstra goes on to say that all four conventions were tried in the Mesa programming language, and the empirical evidence showed that the other three conventions were &quot;a constant source of clumsiness and mistakes&quot;.  The essay is well worth a read.</p>
<p>The value of Dijkstra's inclusive/exclusive convention is particularly clear when dealing with time spans.  Consider two adjacent time ranges in Dijkstra's convention: 1:00 - 2:00, 2:00 - 3:00.  Now try to express these ranges with the inclusive/inclusive convention.  What is the upper bound on the lower range? 1:59?  1:59:59?  What about milliseconds?  <em>Et cetera</em>.  The upper bound would depend on the resolution to which we measure time.  The same problem applies to the exclusive/exclusive convention.</p>
<p>So prefer Dijkstra's inclusive/exclusive convention for any ranges.</p>
